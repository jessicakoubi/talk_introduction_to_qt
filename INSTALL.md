# Install

The examples for this series have been tested on python 3.8 and 3.9 but should work on earlier versions of python 3 as well.

The external libraries needed are in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file and can be installed with pip. Ideally in a virtual environement
using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/venv.html) for example as shown below.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jessicakoubi/talk_introduction_to_qt.git
cd talk_introduction_to_qt

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
